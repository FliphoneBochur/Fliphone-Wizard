# Fliphone-Wizard

See my post on [JTech](https://www.jtechforums.org/t/fliphone-wizard/1468) about this project.

In short, this is a program that I spend around 5 months working on in 2023. I stopped working on it after the Apps4Flip forums closed. I now want to share my work with the public and see if anybody would like to contribute to potentially make this a nice, finished product.
