# Fliphone Wizard
## Made By: Fliphone Bochur 
***
## What
The purpose of this program is to provide a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of installing and uninstalling apps through ADB for those who are new to flip phones and ADB. There are currently 37 apps to choose from.

The program uses ADB (Android Debug Bridge), an Android software that allows computers to run commands on Android phones. 

Please note that this program is designed specifically for Android flip phones and will not work on any phone running KaiOS or any other operating system. 

Additionally, most filters do not allow the use of ADB on your phone.

## Credits
I would like to start by giving a massive shoutout and Yasher Koach to the entire Apps4Flip forum, an amazing community mostly comprised of yeshiva bochurim who try to help anybody with any problems they may have. I'm proud to be part of such a great community!

I'd also like to give special thanks to @Biden2020prez, whose program "LGFlip-Kosher" inspired this program, and for his graduation hats ;).

Thank you to the amazing community on Stack Overflow who already had answers to any questions I had.

Thank you to Apps4Flip for the banner.

Special thanks to YK for his help on the Sonim phones.

Special thanks to @NoTech who's post with Schok commands helped.

Thank you to all the guys in yeshiva for trusting me with their wide variety of phones.

## User Responsibily
Please use this program responsibly. It is important that you only use it on your phone or on the phone of someone who has given you permission to do so. It is crucial that you do not steal someone else's (even your brother's) phone and tamper with it without consulting with them, a parent, or a legal guardian first.

## Filter Disclaimer
This program removes system apps through ADB, but it does not block factory resetting. Please note that it is not a real filter, and it is only intended for those who don not want to have access to their phone's browser and similar things that a Ben Torah should not have while still keeping other apps. As Apps4Flip website states, 
> "Parents, bochurim, and yungerleit be warned: A filter is a must for using these 4G phones. A person owning one of these phones without a filter is placing himself/herself in a really, really bad situation. For this same reason, we provide kosher apps and not telegram, WhatsApp, Chrome, YouTube, etc. As for which filters work with these apps, and which filter is better or worse, we do not take a position, as things are constantly changing. Please consult with your local TAG office, GEDER office, Livigent, etc., to find out what your options are."

## Apps Disclaimer
Please make sure that you do not turn your flip phone into a smartphone. The purpose of putting apps on a flip phone is to avoid getting a smartphone and being exposed to the distractions and tumah out there. People often ask me to put apps on their flip phones, and I warn them that they may end up spending too much time on their phone and regret it. I have had many people return to me later asking to remove most of the apps because they got addicted to their phone. Just be careful. As Apps4Flip says, "Our goal is to prevent people from getting smartphones, not to help desperate bochurim turn their flip phone into one!"
